                              Our dogs are rescued from reserves mainly across the province of Saskatchewan, although we have also rescued from neighbouring provinces as well.  The dogs we rescue are confirmed strays (having no owner).

                              We choose to focus on reserve strays because of a number of reasons.  First, the health and safety risk they present can be dangerous to community members.  As stray numbers grow, the dogs begin to form packs and claim territory.  With strength in numbers in mind, attacks can also become more frequent, as the dogs are fighting for survival.  Having numerous unfixed, unvaccinated dogs running around contributes to the spreading of diseases and parasites that can be passed along to humans.  We want members to feel safe in their own communities, and to not be wary of their children playing outside!  Second, because of the large number of unfixed dogs running around, they multiply exponentially.  The amount of strays can very quickly get out of hand, leading to sometimes hundreds of stray dogs in one community.  These dogs are often severely malnourished, injured, and sick.  They need help, and we can give it.

                              As a registered Not-for-profit Organization, we rely 100% on donations to help these dogs.  We organize fundraisers and bottle drives, sell gift baskets, and receive monetary and supply donations.  Our supplies come from both individuals as well as local businesses in Regina and surrounding areas.

                              Our dogs are located in foster homes throughout the city.  We do not have a central location to house all of our dogs in, as we focus our attention to helping them adjust in a home environment with one on one attention, care and love.  We find this model to be very effective in helping the dogs settle into a family environment and we rely on our wonderful foster families to help us care for our furry friends until they are able to find their forever homes!

                              It depends!  Our dogs must meet a number of minimal requirements before being adopted. They must:
                              Be a minimum of 8 weeks old
                              Go through a two (2) week medical quarantine
                              Receive an all-clear vet check up
                              Receive their first round of DA2PP (distemper parvo combination vaccine)
                              Recieve deworming medication and any other necessary medication to completely treat internal or external parasites

                              The first step in adopting a dog from us is to fill out the online adoption application.  After we receive the application, it will be looked over by our adoption coordinator.  Once we have approved the application for adoption, we set up a 3-day ‘adoption trial’, and see how the dog adjusts to life in their new home before signing the adoption contract.  The adoption contract is then signed, adoption fees paid, and a family photo taken with the newest family member!

                              It depends on the age/status of the dog! Unfixed dogs (due to age or timing of adoption availability) have an adoption fee of $200.00 plus $100.00 spay/neuter deposit.  This deposit is returned upon receiving proof of spay/neuter at 6 months of age, or ASAP after the adoption date.  Fixed dogs have an adoption fee of $300.00.
